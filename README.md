VfxPyro is an interactive effect sample with Unity Visual Effect Graph, which
launches fireworks on the screen with user interactions.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Unity 2019.3
- Compute shader compatible graphics

VfxPyro runs on Universal Render Pipeline, but VFX Graph requires compute
shader capability, which means it's not compatible with legacy mobile devices.
